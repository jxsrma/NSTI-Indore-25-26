**Question:**
👉 *What is the **average daily water intake**?*

**Focus:**

* Create a **Card visual**
* aggregation (Average)

---

## 🔹 SECTION 2: Simple Comparisons (Core Power BI Strength)

### **3. Gender-wise Comparison**

**Question:**
👉 *Do males and females differ in average water intake?*

**Focus:**

* Bar chart
* Axis: Gender
* Values: Avg Daily Water Intake

* distribution concept

---

### **7. Weight vs Water Intake**

**Question:**
👉 *Does body weight influence water consumption?*

## 🔹 SECTION 5: Simple Insights

### **10. Key Insight Question**

**Question:**
👉 *Based on visuals, who needs to focus more on hydration?*

**Expected Discussion:**
