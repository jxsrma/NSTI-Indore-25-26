## **📝 Q1. Library Book Late Fee System (Real-life Story)**

A library charges late fees based on how many days a book is overdue.

You are given a list of overdue days for 6 books:

```python
overdue_days = [0, 3, 10, 1, 5, 12]
```

Rules:

* **0–3 days** → ₹10
* **4–7 days** → ₹20
* **8+ days** → ₹50

### **Task:**

Write a Python program to:

1. Loop through the days
2. Calculate late fee for each book
3. Store the book number as key and fee as value in a dictionary
4. Print the final dictionary

### **Example Output:**

```
{1: 10, 2: 10, 3: 50, 4: 10, 5: 20, 6: 50}
```

```python
steps = [3500, 8000, 12000, 5000, 4000, 15000, 9000]
```

### **Task:**

Write a Python program that:

1. Creates a new list of days where steps were **10,000 or more**
2. Calculates the **average steps of the entire week**
3. Stores results in a dictionary:

```
{
  "high_activity_days": [...],
  "weekly_average": value
}
```

### **Expected Output Example:**

```
{
  'high_activity_days': [12000, 15000],
  'weekly_average': 8360
}
```
