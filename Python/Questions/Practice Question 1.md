### ðŸ§  **Python Practice Questions**

1. **Identifiers:**
   Write a Python program that defines three variables using valid identifiers to store your name, age, and city. Then print them in a single line.
>  Example: `My name is Ram, I am 20 years old and I live in Indore`

2. **Invalid Identifiers:**
   Try creating variables with invalid names (like `2name`, `my-name`, `for`) and observe the errors. Write comments explaining why they are invalid.

3. **Multi-line Statement:**
   Write a Python program that calculates the total marks of 5 subjects using the backslash (`\`) for line continuation.

4. **Parentheses for Multi-line:**
   Use parentheses to write a multi-line mathematical expression that adds and multiplies numbers, then print the result.

5. **Quotation Marks:**
   Write three print statements using **single**, **double**, and **triple quotes** to print the following:
   `"Python is fun"`, `'Hello World'`, and a multi-line string about yourself.

6. **Escape Characters:**
   Print this exact line using escape sequences:
   `He said, "I'm learning Python!"`

7. **Comments:**
   Write a short Python program with **single-line** and **multi-line comments** explaining what your code does.

8. **Variables and Input:**
   Take user input for name and age, store them in variables, and display:
   `"Hello <name>, you are <age> years old."`

9. **Multiple Variable Assignment:**
   Assign values to three variables (`x`, `y`, `z`) in one line, and print their sum.

10. **Literals:**
    Create and print examples of **string**, **integer**, **float**, **boolean**, and **complex** literals.

11. **Data Types:**
    Create variables of different data types and use `type()` to display their types.

12. **String Concatenation:**
    Write a program that concatenates two strings and displays them with a space in between.

13. **Type Conversion (int to float):**
    Convert an integer value `25` into a float and print both values with their types.

14. **Type Conversion (string to int):**
    Take a numeric string from the user and convert it into an integer before adding 10 to it.

15. **Arithmetic Operators:**
    Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs all arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.

16. **Comparison Operators:**
    Compare two numbers using `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=` and print the results.

17. **Assignment Operators:**
    Demonstrate all compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `**=`, `%=`) using one variable.

18. **Logical Operators:**
    Write a program that checks whether a number is **greater than 10** and **less than 50** using logical operators.

19. **Identity Operators:**
    Create two variables with the same value and check if they refer to the same memory location using `is` and `is not`.

20. **Operator Precedence:**
    Write a program to evaluate the following expression and explain the output using comments:

    ```python
    result = 10 + 3 * 2 ** 2
    print(result)
    ```
